This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
```{r}
data <-read.csv("LI_table_for_mediation.csv")
```

```{r}
library(mediation)  
model <- lm(LI_1 ~ age_yrs, data = data)
data$LI_residual <- residuals(model)

model.M <- lm(mullen_VDQ ~ mullen_NVDQ, data = data)  
model.Y <- lm(LI_residual ~ mullen_VDQ + mullen_NVDQ, data = data)  
results <- mediate(model.M, model.Y, treat = "mullen_NVDQ", mediator = "mullen_VDQ", boot = TRUE, sims = 5000)  
summary(results)  
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
